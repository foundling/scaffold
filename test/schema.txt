**say the root is specified on command line, and will be created and will contain everything in this file

validate file and get minimal indent value (probably 0, but could be larger)
if not valid, throw error
otherwise, take min indent and consider it your baseline root indentation value
start reading lines

    if they end in /, make a new node with current node the parent
        node: {name: 'dirname', children: [] }
        children can be nodes or strings

    if the indentation increases
        make values in new node 

relative increase in indent is signal of a child
    if that child ends in a slash (dir), NEW NODE
    otherwise LEAF (file)

traversal mechanism:
if dir:
    create new node
     

schema:

            parent: '',
            children: [
                'f2.txt',
                'f2.js'
